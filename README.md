x86 Assembly Language Series | (Computer Architecture Coursework)
• Completed 12 progressively complex assembly programming labs covering
fundamental computer architecture concepts
• Technical Focus: x86 instruction set, memory management, stack operations,
function calls, recursion, and low-level I/O
• Key Projects:
o Implemented recursive algorithms with proper stack frame management
o Developed string manipulation libraries using pointer arithmetic
o Created floating-point arithmetic operations at the assembly level
o Built dynamic link libraries for modular code organization
